It seems like you're encountering permission issues while trying to run ntfsfix on /dev/sda1, likely because you don't have the necessary privileges. Here are a few things you can try:

Run as root: Make sure you're running the command with root privileges. You can try using sudo before the command:

bash Copy code: & sudo ntfsfix -d /dev/sda1 This will prompt you for your password and then execute the command with elevated privileges.

Check permissions: Ensure that your user has the necessary permissions to access the device. You might need to adjust the permissions or the ownership of the device file /dev/sda1.

Unmount the partition: If the partition is currently mounted, try unmounting it first:

bash Copy code & sudo umount /dev/sda1 After unmounting, try running ntfsfix again.

Check for other processes: Make sure there are no other processes accessing the device that might be causing it to be read-only.
